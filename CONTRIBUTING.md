Contributing
============

### Help! It's my first time.

Welcome! You may wish to read GitHub's [orientation][], or learn the [Markdown][]<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" title="see footnote">ยน</a> syntax for rich text.

Prefer using the [issue tracker][] for all communication.  I may miss posts to the mailing list or cinnamon-spices website. 

### I want to help translate.

Translation files are in the [`po`][] directory.

A pull request is best -- it's easier than you think.  But I will take contributions in any form: email, carrier pigeon...

I can normally merge your changes and release a new version within three days.

###### new languages

I'm happy to provide new language templates.  Ask and you shall receive.

To make one yourself, install the `gettext` package and run `msginit`, passing 

- the correct locale code for your language `-l` (ex: `ko_KR` is Korean)
- the matching `.po` output filename `-o` (ex: `ko.po`)

```sh
$ cd po/
$ msginit -l ko_KR -o ko.po -i weather@mockturtl.pot
```

Simply open the new file and fill in values, then send it to me.

It's okay if you don't use them all.  Every line helps.

### I found a bug.

Please mention your distro, Cinnamon version, and applet version.

### I have a feature request, or code changes.

Squash your changes into a single commit, if possible.  I will probably make some adjustments and ask you for a code review.

I can't guarantee I will respond to these issues promptly, or ever. Feel free to @mention me in the issue comments if too much time has passed.

###### Style guide

New code should have:

- [no semicolons][]
- [commas first][]
- 2-space indentation
- short (LoC) functions with a consistent level of abstraction
- [well-formatted commit messages][git-log-fmt]
